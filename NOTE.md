I choose to use `SCSS` to create stylesheets, and have a watcher to auto generate CSS files. Then `CSS Modules` converts CSS to objects for components. 3. To make `CSS Modules` and `JSS` work together, I modified `index.js` follow [link](https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability) to re-order the generated stylesheets' position in html <header/>.
